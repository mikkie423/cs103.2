	If you are taking doctor prescribed iron tablets, you must wait until you have completed your treatment before you can donate.)

	or a body piercing, you must wait 3 months following the procedure before you can donate. Note: If the body piercing was performed
	by a registered health professional (i.e. pharmacist, GP) and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate after 12 hours.)

- Males: Have you had anal or oral sex with another man, or have you used PEP/PrEP in the last 3 months? (If you are a man, you cannot donate blood
	for 3 months following anal or oral sex, with or without a condom, with another man. Using an antiviral HIV medicine also prohibits you from donating for 3 months.)

	and for how long, you may still be able to donate either now or in the future.)
